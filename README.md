# Spot_fake_review
Comprehensive work on spotting fake reviews, using linguistic and behavioral features.

# Abstract
In order to keep online reviews a trustworthy source
of information utilized by consumers to make smarter and better
decisions, we developed an effective machine learning algorithm
that can classify reviews as either fake or real. We propose a
model that extracts both review and reviewer information for
classification. The reviews are preprocessed and vectorized by N -
gram, word2vec and combined in various stemming models, and
the performances using the different methods are compared in
multiple experiments. For user information analysis, we introduce
3 behavioural features as well as build upon previously extracted
features. The reviews are classified by a neural network model
and combining the behavioral features with the content-based
features finally exhibits an improvement in accuracy compared
to baseline.
